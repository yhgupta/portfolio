            someone has recently learned the
            web-development and want to apply its skills to any of project and in the other part of world one the
            project mentor
            needing the web-developer so that the project mentor than can hire the person, in this way both the tasks
            are completed
            To sort this, we use CodeChef API, Alibaba Cloud to create a server and Android Development to create the
            application

            It was created in All India level Hackathon conducted by ISTE, MANIT Chapter,
            in this if we want to deploy the flood rescue team during the time of flood then
            in our program it will show us the exact area which is most likely to get affected
            by the flood, if it occurs or has occurred, using the elevation height from the sea
            level as one of the key factors in deciding the area.We have used the image-processing, python as our major
            tech-stack.
